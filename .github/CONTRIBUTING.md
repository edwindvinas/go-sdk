# Pull Requests

If you want to contribute to the repository, here's a quick guide:
  1. Fork the repository
  2. The GOPATH environment variable is used to specify directories outside of $GOROOT that contain the source for Go projects and their binaries. Example:
  ```sh
  export GOPATH="$HOME/workspace/go-workspace"
  export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
  ````
  3. Have the following directory layout
  ```sh
  mkdir $GOPATH/{src,bin,pkg}
  ```
  4. Clone the respository into `src/github.com/watson-developer-cloud` directory
  5. Use [dep][dep] dependency manager.
  On MacOS you can install or upgrade to the latest released version of [dep][dep] with Homebrew
  ```sh
    $ brew install dep
    $ dep ensure
  ```
  6. Check your code for lint issues
  ```sh
  golangci-lint run
  ```
  7. Develop and test your code changes `go test ./...`
  8. Commit your changes:
  * Commits should follow the [Angular commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines). This is because our release tool uses this format for determining release versions and generating changelogs. To make this easier, we recommend using the [Commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) with the `cz-conventional-changelog` adapter.
  9. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the **master** branch
